# Alias Reloaded (Minecraft b1.7.3) Full SRC Code
This has the full client + minecraft src code included since there are callouts under the main game function.

I have not worked on this in 5-6 years.

The Java version required is very old and I do not have time to mess with this.
Uploading here for my portfolio. This is available for anyone to use.

Client theme is based off of Team Avolitions Reliant client. At some point I will try to re-compile these into functional jar versions to run in the official launcher.
